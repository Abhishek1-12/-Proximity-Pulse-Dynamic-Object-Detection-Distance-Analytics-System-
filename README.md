=======================================================================================================================================
This project integrates a proximity sensor and LCD interface to create a versatile tool that detects objects, counts occurrences, converts counts to real-world distances (cm/m), and stores calibration settings via EEPROM. Ideal for conveyor belt monitoring, security systems, or STEM education, it offers live data visualization, a stopwatch, and serial-command control for seamless automation and learning.
